# TANDEMLOOP Screening Test-1

### Hi, I am **Syed Mohammed Jawwad**.  
### This is my submission for the **TANDEMLOOP first screening test**.  
### I solved all 4 problems in **Java** using very simple beginner-level code.

---
Language used : ## Java

## Problems

- `Problem1.java` — Simple calculator using a `Calculator` class. It asks for two numbers and an operation (add, sub, mul, div) and prints the result.
- `Problem2.java` — Prints the first `a` odd numbers. It asks for one integer `a` and prints `1 3 5 ...` `a` times.
- `Problem3.java` — Prints odd numbers up to `a` (if `a` is even it prints up to the previous odd). It asks for one integer `a` and prints the odd numbers separated by spaces.
- `Problem4.java` — Count how many numbers in the input list are multiples of `1` to `9`. It reads one line of numbers separated by spaces and prints a map-like result: `{1: X, 2: Y, ... 9: Z}`.
- `README.md` — This file (simple explanation and steps).
- `.gitignore` — Basic ignore for class files and VS Code folder.

> Note: The test asked for files named `Problem-1`, `Problem-2`, etc. Java class/file names cannot include `-` (hyphen). So I used `Problem1.java` etc. I mentioned this in the README so the reviewer knows.

## Quick run instructions (Terminal)

Open a terminal in the project folder and run each program like this:

```bash
# Compile
javac Problem1.java
# Run
java Problem1
```

Repeat for `Problem2.java`, `Problem3.java`, `Problem4.java`.

**Problem4 input example (when it asks):**

```
1 2 8 9 12 46 76 82 15 20 30
```

**Expected output format example:**

```
{1: 11, 2: 8, 3: 4, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 1, 9: 1}
```

## How to run in VS Code (if you use it)

1. Install Java JDK 17+ and the **Extension Pack for Java** in VS Code.
2. Open the folder (File → Open Folder...).
3. Click on a `.java` file and use the **Run** button that appears above `main`, or use the terminal to compile and run as shown above.

That’s it.  
Thank you.
